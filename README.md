## 0xMacro Engineering Fellowship

I was one of 20 students accepted into block 6 of the 0xMacro engineering fellowingship, where I was taught Solidity security and best practices over 6 weeks.

Throughout the course I learned about design patterns, security vulnerabilities, inner workings of the EVM, built multiple contracts, was audited, and wrote tons of tests.

I worked on building an initial coin offering (ICO), a crowdfunding contract (think GoFundme but for Web3), a DAO similar Governor Bravo, and a liquidity pool similar to Uniswap V2. Additonally, I also worked on using multi sigs (Gnosis), merkle drops and more.
