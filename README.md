# 0xMacro Engineering Fellowship

In this repository you can find the code I wrote for the [0xMacro Engineering Fellowship](https://0xmacro.com/engineering-fellowship). I was one of 20 students accepted into block 6 of the fellowship, where I was taught Solidity security and best practices over 6 weeks.

Throughout the course I learned about design patterns, security vulnerabilities, inner workings of the EVM, audits, and testing.

I worked on building an initial coin offering (ICO), a crowdfunding contract (GoFundme but for Web3), a DAO inspired by Governor Bravo, and a liquidity pool similar to Uniswap V2. Additionally, I also worked on using multisigs (Gnosis), merkle drops and more.
