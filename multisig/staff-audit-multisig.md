# Design Exercise

You captured most tradeoffs between the 3 configurations, but don't forget about the the case where keys are lost. In my experience as a wallet dev is it _far_ more likely for people to lose their keys, rather than going rogue and becoming malicious. The N-N case is almost certain folly because of this; it only takes a single person to lose their private key for the whole multisig to become useless.

Great job!
